      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Honors is Manhattan's premier bridge club. It was founded in 1993 by Gail Greenberg and for the second year in a row is the largest bridge club in the country by far. To put our size in perspective, Honors offers more games just for the developing player, than 95% of the other bridge clubs in the country have games.</p>
      <p>Our entry level Beginner 1 course is unique. We have probably created more bridge players than anyone else in the country. </p>
